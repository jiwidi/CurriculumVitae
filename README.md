# Curriculum Vitae
[![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/jiwidi/CurriculumVitae/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jiwidi/CurriculumVitae/actions/workflows/main.yml)

My personal CV.

It's linked with overleaf to sync `.tex` files and has a github action listening to push events to build `cv.pdf` and push it to master. CICD for your CV!
